open git bash in the folder you want to create a new project

## Important Git commands

git clone <url>  ## downloads folder from git into the folder on desktop

## if the original git folder belongs to someone else, first fork the folder into your git repo and then clone
## directly cloning will create a problem since changes can be pushed only into yor github repo. Once that is done you have to make a pull request for the admin to merge into main branch

## after making any changes

Step 1:

git add "file name.extension" ## add file into staging

git add -A 					  ## add all changed files into staging


Step 2:

git commit -m "Message" ## commit changes to staging with message; message is mandatory. Not passing a message will force open a new message window!!

step 3

git push origin master  ## push changes to master branch in you own github repo
